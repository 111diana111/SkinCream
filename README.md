# SkinCream

Features

- Monitor the level of hydration, elasticity, and the collagen density of the user's skin;
- Monitor the temperature and humidity of the place (bathroom counter/fridge) in which the users store
their skincare product;
- For new products, collect cream viscosity and density data (for accuracy reasons, this feature is not
recommended for products which have been already opened and had an ongoing contact
 with the storage environment)
- Extract the core ingredients behind each skincare formulation and calculate the effect of the storage
environment on the variations in density and viscosity noted in the product);
- Estimate the effects of the environment paameters on the products' effectiveness
- Scan the product absorption degree within the user's skin on two controllable parameters (egal dosage,
available wihin the market for capsules and ampoules, and the 30 minutes time absoption estimate
circulating within the dermatology community); Uncontrollable variables likely to affect accuracy relate
to the unique product distribution on the skin from one application to the other, the amount absorbed
by the users' fingers during the application process, and nevertheless, variation within the user's skin type
and skincare routine (eg: different levels of absorption can be noticed before and after professional
cleansing;
- Transmit user data to relevant parties (eg: a dermatologist or a SPA technician)
